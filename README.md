# Automiter Package Setup Guide

This guide outlines the necessary steps to set up your Azure DevOps organization, GitLab groups, and repository for importing the "automiter" package.

## Prerequisites

- An **Azure DevOps** organization.
- A **GitLab** account with appropriate permissions to create groups and repositories.
- Access to the **Suite** repository from Automiter on GitHub: [Automiter Suite GitHub Repository](https://github.com/automiter/Suite.git).

## Steps for Setup

### 1. Create Azure DevOps Organization

To begin using Automiter, you'll first need an Azure DevOps organization. If you don't already have one, follow these steps:

- Go to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/).
- Sign in with your Microsoft account.
- Create a new organization by clicking **Create organization**.
- Choose a name for your organization and follow the prompts.

### 2. Create a Project in Azure DevOps

Once your organization is set up, you need to create a project to host your pipelines and artifacts:

- Inside your Azure DevOps organization, navigate to the **Projects** section.
- Click **New Project**.
- Name your project "Automiter".
- Set the visibility to either **Private** or **Public** depending on your needs.
- Click **Create** to create the project.

### 3. Create GitLab Master Group

Next, youâ€™ll need to create a master group in GitLab:

- Log in to your GitLab account.
- Navigate to the **Groups** section from the sidebar.
- Click **New group**.
- Name the group **Master**.
- Set the group visibility to your preferred setting (Public or Private).
- Click **Create group**.

### 4. Create Subgroup Named "Automiter"

Within the **Master** group in GitLab, create a new subgroup named "Automiter":

- Inside the **Master** group, click on **New subgroup**.
- Name the subgroup **Automiter**.
- Set the visibility to your preferred setting.
- Click **Create subgroup**.

### 5. Create Repository Named "Suite" in GitLab

Now, create the repository for importing the code from the Automiter GitHub repository:

- Navigate to the **Automiter** subgroup within GitLab.
- Click on **New project**.
- Name the project **Suite**.
- Select **Import project**.
- Under **Import project from**, choose **GitHub**.
- In the **GitHub repository URL** field, enter: `https://github.com/automiter/Suite.git`.
- Follow the prompts to import the repository from GitHub into GitLab.

### 6. Import Automiter Code into GitLab Repository

Once you have completed the above steps, the **Suite** repository from Automiter will be imported into your GitLab **Automiter** subgroup.

You can now configure your Azure DevOps pipelines to interact with the **Suite** repository in GitLab for your development process.

## Conclusion

You have now completed the setup to import the **Automiter** package. You can start using it by following the next steps in the Automiter documentation to integrate it with your workflow.
